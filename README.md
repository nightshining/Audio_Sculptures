Audio_Sculptures
================

The "Audio Sculptures" ipad app is a creative application in the Minimal and Conceptual art esthetic. It focuses on using openFrameworks core only functions and classes to build unique interactive digital sound sculptures. You are intially prompted by a blinking spot on the top left hand side of the screen. This button randomly generates 1 - 3 different digital sculptures. Each sculpture has different visual actions and corresponding sounds when swiped or tapped. It creates generative audio in the sense that the computer randomly places different sculptures in each scene, but every sculpture's sound fits with the other/s.
